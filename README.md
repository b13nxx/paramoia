Cure for being paranoia about parameters which are coming in every single wrong way to our functions.

## What is actually?

Well, it is simple utility library for parameter checking.

## Who is for?

- If you don't want to spare time for understand other _JSON or OBJECT SCHEMA_ based validator libraries,
- If you don't want to deal with complex _JSON or OBJECT STRUCTURES_ for being able to validate some parameters,
- If you're more like pass or fail line by line kind a guy,
- If you want simple, light, easy-to-understand library,

You could use this library.

## How to install?

Run `npm install paramoia --save` then you're ready to go with:
